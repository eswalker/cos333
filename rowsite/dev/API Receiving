SENDING DATA FROM MOBILE APP TO WEB APP

Mobile app already has:
	-List of athletes and IDs
	-Most recent practice ID
	-Start lineups

Web app needs:
	-Piece
	-Lineup
	-One result per lineup -- will be assigned to all of the athletes in the lineup

Steps for sending data to web app (DO THIS FOR EACH PIECE)
	-Post piece's data json to json/piece/add
	-For each lineup, post json to json/lineup/add
	-For each lineup's result, post json to json/result/add


/json/piece/add
POST:
	api_key

	json in this format:
		{"pracitce": PRACTICE_ID, "name": #_OF_THE_PIECE (OR DISTANCE) -- your choice on the convention, "datetime": CURRENT_DATETIME}

		ex. {"practice": 6, "name": "2000 meters", "datetime": "2014-04-22T02:39:47.888Z"}

	I will then use this data to create a piece. I will then return that piece's id to you.

/json/lineup/add
POST:
	api_key

	json in this format:
		{"athletes": [ARRAY_OF_ATHLETE_IDs], "position": BOAT'S_POSITION_AS_STRING, "boat": NUMERICAL_ID_OF_BOAT, "piece": PIECE_NUMBER_YOU_JUST_GOT}

		-- most of that should be the same as the original lineup you received; the only differences should be the athlete ID's and piece #

		ex. {"athletes": [4, 5, 10, 11, 14], "position": "1V", "boat": 3, "piece": 10}

	I will use this to create a lineup. You will not receive any data in return.

/json/results/add

	api_key

	json: {"athletes": [ARRAY_OF_ATHLETES_IN_THE_LINEUP], "distance": DISTANCE_METERS, "time": TIME_SECONDS, "piece": PIECE_ID_YOU_GOT, "datetime": CURRENT_DATETIME}

	ex. {"athletes": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "distance": 2000, "time": 390, "piece": 2, "datetime": "2014-04-18T21:24:40.809Z"}

	I will use this to create a new result for each athlete in the lineup. You will not receive any data in return.
